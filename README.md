# C projects

This were projects I did for subject "Principles of low-level programming".
Name of HWs:
<ul>
<li>HW01: Programmer calculator</li>
<li>HW02: Minesweeper</li>
<li>HW03: Network traffic analyzer</li>
<li>HW04: Xpath</li>
<li>HW05: Permission check.</li>
</ul>

I am most proud of HW03 and HW05, 
we had roughly one and half week to complete each project, so they are not perfect.
Assignments were graded by unit and integration tests not visible to us.
Some funtions were premaded or badly implemented by teachers and we could use them after revision and correction.
